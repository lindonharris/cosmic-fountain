# Claude Memory Cleanup Summary - cosmic-fountain

## Overview
Successfully pruned cosmic-fountain's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file to remove references to deleted dojo-mcp features from v2.2.0.

## Removed References
The following features were removed from Claude memory:

### ❌ Deleted Features
1. **Debug Intelligence (`debug_issue` command)**
   - Previously: `./the-dojo/dojo-mcp/bin/dojo-mcp debug_issue '<error message>'`
   - Status: Command no longer exists in dojo-mcp v2.2.0

2. **Error Tracking and Learning**
   - Previously: Historical solutions, pattern matching, context-aware fixes
   - Status: All error tracking components removed

3. **File Access Pattern Learning**
   - Previously: "10x faster, learns patterns, improves with every search"
   - Status: Learning functionality removed

4. **CLAUDE.md Boost Functionality**
   - Previously: Intelligence growth system
   - Status: Boost system completely removed

### ✅ Retained Features
1. **Portfolio Status** (`status` command)
2. **Basic File Search** (`find` command) - simplified, no learning
3. **Session Context** (`where-was-i` command) - if available
4. **Repository Scanning** (`scan` command)

## Before/After Comparison

### Before (Outdated)
```
### ⚡ Critical Rules
1. NEVER use `grep` → ALWAYS use `dojo-mcp find`
2. NEVER use `find` → ALWAYS use `dojo-mcp find`  
3. NEVER debug blindly → ALWAYS use `dojo-mcp debug_issue`
4. ALWAYS start with `where-was-i` for context
```

### After (Current)
```
### Note on Removed Features
The following features have been removed from dojo-mcp v2.2.0:
- ❌ Debug intelligence (`debug_issue` command)
- ❌ Error tracking and learning
- ❌ File access pattern learning
- ❌ CLAUDE.md boost functionality

For debugging, use standard tools and Claude's built-in capabilities.
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Eliminates confusion about non-existent features
- **Neutral**: Core functionality (scan, status, find) still documented
- **Guidance**: Clear note on removed features prevents user frustration

## Dependency Log Updated
- Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` tracking entry
- Added cleanup notes and timestamp
- Added rollback instruction for emergency recovery

## Verification
✅ All tracked artifacts still exist
✅ Claude memory aligned with actual dojo-mcp v2.2.0 capabilities
✅ Clear documentation of what was removed and why
